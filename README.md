# conversarium

**conversarium** is a deterministic, generative dialogue engine for generating and engaging in any structured conversation.

- build structured conversation trees for sales, therapy, law, onboarding, rpgs, etc.
- flows are deterministic (traversable like a graph), powered by generative ai for realism.
- practice natural dialogue, get instant feedback, and analyze your progress.
- use built-in flows (e.g. SPIN selling, therapy) or design your own.
- utilizes voice recognition and intent embeddings to match you to the next node in the conversation.
- works in-browser, no downloads, api for integrating flows into any app (web, game, custom ux).
